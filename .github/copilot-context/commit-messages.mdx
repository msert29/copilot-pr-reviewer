Commit messages

Follow the generally accepted standard way of writing git commit messages, which is described well here: https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53 

Please start the first line of the commit message with a reference to the Jira ticket number in the format VS-XXXX , that makes figuring out what a change relates to later on much easier and we have also configured GitHub to make such links clickable when browsing code / pull requests.

Example of a good commit message:

VS-9865 Use pytest in CircleCI to run the Python unittests

This also uses "circleci tests run" to decide which tests to run, which
enables the "Rerun failed tests" CircleCI functionality, so it's now
possible to rerun just the failed tests.

It also moves the slow data migration tests to their test job.
